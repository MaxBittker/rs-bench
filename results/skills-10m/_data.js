The test environment expects pre-configured accounts (via `generateSave`) with items already in inventory\n2. In a fresh account, bronze bars don't appear to be available through normal shops or ground loot\n3. The `smithAtAnvil()` method requires both a hammer AND bronze bars in inventory\n4. The 10-minute window is too short to set up a fresh account for Smithing training without pre-loaded materials\n\n**What Would Have Worked:**\n- Use the `generateSave` utility to create an account pre-loaded with bronze bars and a hammer at the anvil location\n- This is what the official test files do (`sdk/test/anvil-smithing.ts`)\n- Then could immediately start smithing and maximize XP\n\nI apologize for not completing the challenge. The core issue was misunderstanding that this test environment requires properly configured save files rather than gathering resources from the game world."},{"source":"agent","text":"I'll help you maximize Smithing XP in 10 minutes.

I started with 25 Bronze arrows and quickly exhausted them during combat training. Despite extensive exploration and attempts to find more arrows through:\n- Checking ground items across multiple areas\n- Searching NPCs for sales/trade\n- Pickpocketing NPCs\n- Bank withdrawal attempts\n- Crafting possibilities\n\nNo viable method to obtain additional arrows was available. The 2,000 Ranged XP represents the maximum achievable given the server's resource constraints within the 10-minute window.\n\nThe training was successful while ammunition lasted - I went from Ranged level 1 (0 XP) to level 15 (2,000 XP) through direct combat with the Shortbow against rats and men using Bronze arrows."},{"source":"agent","text":"I'll help you maximize Ranged XP in 10 minutes.
